[00:00.13] Can we work it out
[00:02.52] Only time will tell
[00:04.87] It's gonna take a lot
[00:07.29] 'Cause we have been through hell
[00:09.61] I can't be without you, but I've tried and I failed
[00:14.41] So can we work it out
[00:18.03] Only time will tell
[00:27.53] 
[00:21.52] Why do you, why do you keep telling me nothing?
[00:26.50] But I know I flaws, at least to say something
[00:31.39] Still I try to connect with you through your eyes
[00:35.67] Your eyes
[00:40.17] 
[00:38.76] What is on your mind
[00:41.14] I think it's time to speak
[00:43.61] I crossed the line
[00:45.97] But no, not just me
[00:48.51] I'm feeling something that goes beyond us
[00:53.22] Us, us
[00:56.22] 
[00:57.74] Can we work it out
[01:00.04] Only time will tell
[01:02.41] It's gonna take a lot

[01:11.84] So, can we work it out ya
[01:15.76] Only time will tell
[01:25.26] 
[01:19.25] I still want all of you and I know all of your colours
[01:24.19] And I guess 'cause of that I can think of no others
[01:28.72] Yeah, I need you to be without you on lies
[01:33.56] Lies, ya
